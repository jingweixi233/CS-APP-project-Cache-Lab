# CS-APP-project-Cache-Lab

This is the project in chapter 6 of "Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective".

In this lab, I write two programs for two parts. 

# Part A

In the first part, I write a program to simulate the hit, miss and evict behaviors of an LRU cache memory. 
In the program, I use array to be the data structure for cache. 

# Part B

In the second part, I write a program to optimize cache performance for matrix transpose function.
